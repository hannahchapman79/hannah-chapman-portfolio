        <p className="about-content">Hello! I'm <strong>Hannah Chapman</strong>, a junior developer from the UK, with a unique background in e-commerce and a keen passion for software development.</p>
        <p>I started my career working with digital tools to drive sales and engagement across industries, and that experience has given me a firsthand look at the power of code to transform business results and user experiences. Recently, I completed an intensive JavaScript boot camp at Northcoders, where I strengthened my skills in both back-end and front-end development through exciting projects like an AI-powered plant identifier and a weather app.</p>
        <p>When I&apos;m not coding, you&apos;ll find me practicing yoga and pilates, traveling to discover new places and cuisines, or volunteering for causes I care about. Whether it&apos;s teaching English abroad or helping run a lively hostel, I love staying connected to communities around the world.</p>
        <p>Thanks for visiting my portfolioâ€”let&apos;s connect!</p>
