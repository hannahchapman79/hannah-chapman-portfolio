        <p>I&apos;m from Leicester, UK and have over 4 years of <span>e-commerce</span> experience, which I&apos;ve balanced alongside a part-time <span>business management degree.</span> This combination has given me a well-rounded understanding of both business strategy and how technology can make a real difference.
         </p> <p>Recently, I completed a <span>JavaScript</span> bootcamp at <span>Northcoders</span>, where I strengthened my development skills and learned to apply complex computer science concepts to my work.</p>
        <p>When I&apos;m not coding, you&apos;ll find me practicing <span>yoga</span> and <span>pilates</span>, <span>traveling</span> to discover new places and cuisines, or <span>volunteering</span> for causes I care about. </p>
        <p>Thanks for visiting my portfolioâ€”let&apos;s connect!</p>
